## Seminar 1: _Transport and continuity equations_

September 21st, 2023

- Characteristics of the equation: $d_t x(t) = u(t, x)$
- Solution when $u(t, x) = ax + b$
- Development of formulas
- Change of the density $\rho(t, x(t))$ along characteristics $x(t)$
- Numeric calculations using `ode45()`
- Visualizations of the results
